## Idea used

Here, we are making use of the Weber fraction to convert the given problem into a differential equation. Since the solution object isn't dependent on time, we calculate it only once, and binary search through the solution array at every iteration

This function has been used as a reference for the ``__init__()`` method in gazel.jl
